"""
game_core.py

UI-agnostic "brain" for a 4-player trick-taking game with:
- 2 teams: Team1 = {P1, P3}, Team2 = {P2, P4}
- 13 tricks per match
- Unclaimed pool: +1 each trick; captured by a team only when any player on that team wins TWO CONSECUTIVE tricks.
- If any pool remains at end of match, it goes to the winner of the last trick.
- Trump is chosen by the "chooser" (may be RANDOM: chooser's 13th card sets trump).
- Must follow lead suit if possible, otherwise play anything (including trump).
- Ranks: 2..14 (14 = Ace), Ace high.

Bot AI:
- Plays solid baseline strategy (follow, beat minimally, save resources).
- Endgame twist: if <= 3 tricks remain and the bot *has control* (won previous trick and is leading),
  it tries to SAVE a strong trump (Q or better) for the *final trick* provided the higher trumps are gone,
  playing a lower/safer card now to secure the last-trick pool capture.
- On the very last trick, it pushes to WIN if possible (plays strongest valid).

Public API (all methods are UI/server-friendly and JSON-ready):

- GameCore(players_mode=None, seed=None)
    players_mode: dict {"P1":"human"/"bot", "P2":"bot", ...}; default all "human"
    seed: optional int for reproducible shuffles (useful for debugging/tests)

- new_match(chooser_index=0)
    Starts a new match with fresh deal. After this, the chooser must pick trump.
    Returns a summary state (JSON-like dict).

- chooser_first_five()
    Returns the chooser's first 5 cards (for UI to display).

- choose_trump_manual(suit) / choose_trump_random()
    Sets trump and completes dealing to 13 cards each. Returns updated state.

- get_state_view(for_player=None)
    Returns complete game state. If for_player is given ("P1"/"P2"/"P3"/"P4"):
    - only that player's hand is revealed; others are hidden (lengths only).

- get_valid_invalid_cards(player_id)
    Returns {"valid":[cards], "invalid":[cards]} for the *current trick*.

- play_card(player_id, card)
    Validates and applies the move; auto-resolves trick on 4th play; updates pools, consecutive tracking,
    next starter, etc. Returns {"events":[...], "state":<updated_state>}, where events includes trick-resolution notes.

- auto_play_until_human()
    If it’s any bot’s turn(s), the core will play for them (with small delays handled by UI/server).
    Returns {"moves":[...], "events":[...], "state":...} after bots have finished until the next human is up
    or the match has ended.

- is_match_over()
    Boolean.

- result()
    Returns final tallies when a match is over (team_tricks, player_tricks, last_trick_winner, trump).

Cards are dictionaries: {"rank": int, "suit": str} e.g., {"rank": 14, "suit": "Spades"}.
All state structures are JSON-serializable.

You can run multiple matches back-to-back by calling:
    new_match(...) -> choose_trump_* -> [turn loop with play_card/auto_play_until_human] -> result()

Note: No I/O, no UI, no printing here — pure logic.
